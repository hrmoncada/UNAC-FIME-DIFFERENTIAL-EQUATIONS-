# UNAC-FIME-DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS (ECUACIONES-DIFERENCIALES)

Introduction to Differential Equations
Welcome to the fascinating world of Differential Equations — the mathematical language of change and dynamics. A differential equation is, at its core, an equation that involves one or more derivatives of an unknown function. Since derivatives represent the rate of change, differential equations allow us to capture how quantities evolve, interact, and respond over time or space.

From modeling the growth of populations in biology, to describing the motion of planets in physics, or analyzing the behavior of circuits in engineering — differential equations are everywhere. They serve as powerful tools to describe real-world phenomena in nearly every scientific field.

Historically, the development of differential equations is deeply tied to the invention of calculus by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. These equations offer insights into how a function changes in relation to one or more independent variables. For example, a simple differential equation might look like:

$$ \frac{dx}{dy} =\sin(x) $$

Or take a more complex one:

$$ \frac{d^3y}{dx^3}  + x\frac{dy}{dx} − 4xy = 0 $$

Throughout this course, we will explore:

* The definition and classification of differential equations
* The order and degree of an equation
* Different methods of solution for both ordinary and partial differential equations
* The qualitative behavior of solutions
* Real-world applications across disciplines

Our goal is not only to solve these equations but also to understand the underlying principles they describe, and to appreciate the elegance of their structure and solutions. So, whether you're an engineer, physicist, biologist, or mathematician, get ready to dive into a subject that beautifully bridges theory and application.

Let’s begin.
